# value of the name_mapping key is a Python expression evaluated at runtime by the eval() function

# Here it is possible to define which labels will be created for each metric, based on the name of the sample
labels:

# Supports wildecards. Multiple sets might match. In this case, they are applied in the same order they appear here.
# Override is possible
  - '*':
    - user_id: user_id
    - unit: unit
    - resource_id: resource_id
    - instance_id: resource_id  # this is overridden for some metrics (e.g. network)
    - tenant_id: project_id

  - disk.device.*:
    - instance_id: resource_id[:36]

  - network.*:
    - instance_id: uuid4regex.search(resource_id).group(0)

  - ip.floating:
    - instance_id: # empty value to unset the label
    - ip_address: resource_metadata['floating_ip_address']
    - operation: resource_metadata['event_type']
